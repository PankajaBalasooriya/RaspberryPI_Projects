# Raspberry Pi Projects - Johns Hopkins University (Coursera)

This repository contains my projects and assignments for the [Raspberry Pi Projects Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/raspberry-pi) offered by Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

## Specialization Overview

The **Raspberry Pi Projects Specialization** is designed to take beginners from the basics to building functional prototypes, home projects, and new creations with custom peripheral hardware and a Raspberry Pi. The specialization consists of four courses:

1. **Beginning Custom Projects with Raspberry Pi**: Building network-connected projects with sensors and motors, accessible from a smartphone. 
2. **Communications and High-Speed Signals with Raspberry Pi**: Exploring modern communication protocols and high-speed signal design. 
3. **Powering Your Home Projects with Raspberry Pi**: Integrating Raspberry Pi into practical home projects.
4. **Designing Hardware for Raspberry Pi Projects**: Designing hardware using open-source tools, including circuit simulation, schematic creation, PCB layout, and 3D modeling.
